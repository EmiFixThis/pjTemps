\section{Equivalent and Stronger Definitions for Security} 

All cryptographic schemes such as RSA, El Gamal, etc. must satisfy the requirements of semantic
security, specifically they must satisfy the Indistinguishable Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) requirement.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IND-CPA} IND-CPA says if an attacker can choose any plaintext and obtain the corresponding ciphertext, then if the system is secure this information does not help them find the private key. However, the issue with CPA is that it depends on the choices of an adversary who is unaware of the secret key. i.e. If the
attacker has two messages then they have no idea if either one contains the key since they don't know what the key is. 
\newline 
In application this classififcation is not sufficient (weakly sufficient) to ensure secure communication. There are situations which occur where the semantic security definition is satisfied but an insecurity still occurs. One
such instance is the case where the user might encrypt their own private key. 
\newline 
By IND-CPA the user can encrypt their private-key but the scheme may return the private-key unencrypted. 
\newline 
By the definition of IND-CPA this action is still classified as secure, even though the scheme has blatantly revealed the users private key.

\section{InfoSec /& it's Objectives} 

\subsection{Base Security Objectives}

There are four basic security objectives that must be considered when constructing any system concerned with securing data or information. These four basic definitions allow for the derivation of all other security objectives which may or may not be necessary to ensure the security of information for a given system.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Confidentiality:} The objective of confidentiality ensures that unauthorized users will not be purposefully (or accidentally) give access to resources protected by the system. 
\item \textbf{Integrity:} Ensures that the resources are preserved, used, and appropriately maintained throughout their life-cycle under the system. That is, any data is not alterable in an undetectable manner, retains the same
accuracy as its created date (or registered modification date), and is complete with respect to its creation and activity log. 
\item \textbf{Availability:}
\item \textbf{Non-repudiation:} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Derived Security Objectives}

Each implementation of a scheme requires a flexible set of security objectives which are dependent upon the context the system and it's users will employ \textbf{TODO:change wording}. The base definitions for the objectives allow the derivation of all other security objectives.

\section{Hardness Assumptions} 

\subsection{Average-case}  
We say a cryptographic algorithm or cryptosystem has average-case hardness if: 
Informally: The mathematical problem the algorithm (or system of
algorithms) is based on cannot be solved in polynomial time by a
standard computer with a slightly more than reasonable amount of resources. 
\newline
More-formally: If a key is chosen at random, then there is no probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that solves the mathematical problem for some non-negligible probability. 

\subsection{Best-case}

\subsection{Worst-case} 
For an average-case security proof we are assured the mathematical problem
the scheme is based on cannot be solved by a classical computer system in polynomial time in all except a negligible set of its random functional instances.
A worst-case security proof carries all the security given by the average-case, but it also covers the small set of functional instances the average-case counts as negligible. 
\newline
Informally, a worst-case security proof takes the functional instance which is
hardest to solve and shows the scheme is as least as strong as that
instance, since there are no harder instances, there does not exist
a computer which can solve its mathematical problem in polynomial time.

\section{Post-quantum cryptography} 
The need for new cryptographic systems developed after Peter Shorr proved that the classical number-theoretic schemes could be "easily" broken by quantum computers. Quantum systems are capable of running algorithms which provide solutions to the mathematical problems the classical schemes base their security reductions on. The development of quantum computing lead to a new area of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography. 
\newline 
Post-quantum cryptography is necessarily distinct from quantum cryptography it's concern is finding and implementing schemes which are secure against quantum-based attacks.
\newline 
Not to be confused with Quantum-cryptography which uses quantum computers to find and implement new quantum cryptosystems.

\section{Lattice-based Cryptography} 
Lattice-based Cryptosystems are a subclass of Post-quantum cryptosystems. A worst-case security proof for a lattice based scheme not only claims security against attacks from classical (current) computer systems, but quantum as well. The drawback is these not as efficient (yet) as other more well known schemes. However, lattice-based schemes claim a unique benefit that other post-quantum schemes do not.

\subsection{Learning with Errors (LWE)}

LWE, has a quantum reduction from SVP. LWE forms the basis of security for many other algorithms which gain SVP as basis for their own security.
 
 
\subsection{Fully Homomorphic Encryption} 
Lattice-based schemes have the potential of providing Fully Homomorphic Encryption to a given cryptosystem. 
The problem which FHE solves is only slightly different than that of PKC. We want to take our encrypted data, send it to an unauthorized party for processing, 
and receive the same results we would get if we had never encrypted it.
\newline
Cryptologists have spent a great deal of their time removing the natural homomorphisms from most schemes like RSA. While at the same time wishing for a doubly homomorphic system.

\subsubsection{Homomorphic Properties of Cryptographic Schemes} 
Many classical public key cryptography methods have a homomorphic property, this property says if add two things together then their sum contains information about those two things.
That is, they use successive operations of addition, multiplication, etc. to create ciphertext. 
We call these schemes Partially Homomorphic since their operations cannot be performed simultaneously. 

Unpadded RSA has this homomorphic property, if we take two RSA messages (ciphertext) which have been encrypted with unpadded RSA, and we multiply them together when we decrypted them we will find that this product contains the two original ciphertexts as subgroups, or embeds the ciphertexts. We say the ciphertexts are homomorphic to modular multiplication. 

RSA and other classical schemes can only evaluate data over the operation they are defined to work on, such as multiplication or addition. 

In cryptography we say a scheme that has this property is malleable and it is not always a good property for the scheme to have. Malleable means that an attacker can change an encrypted message, decrypt it and gain useful information. Lets say that you send 5$ to Eve, then Eve can get enough information to put two zeros behind the five and suddenly youâ€™ve just given Eve 500/$ instead. 

\newline
FHE schemes are not limited to a single operation and can simultaneously compute any number of arbitrary operations. 

All computers operate by using trillions upon trillions of boolean circuits. Boolean circuits are special cases of propositional formulas, truth tables, where the only output ever given by the system is either yes or no; in computer terms zero or one. 

Boolean circuits have three basic functions from which the rest can be derived, they are AND, OR, and NOT. You can combine these two of functions to get a total set of sixteen different boolean functions. Engineers have been using these functions for ages, but cryptographers were stuck with one.

\section{Ideal Lattice-based Cryptography}
The additional application areas and ease of implementation due to ideal ring structure is convenient, the choice of ring its self is as important as the problem it is based upon. An advantage of Ring-LWE is its much smaller set of keys; the ring allows for more efficient and larger ranges in application areas. 

Ideal Ring-LWE allows an even broader range of applications and efficiency than RLWE due to the additional structure provided by the principal ideals.

\subsubsection{Gentry's Scheme}
[Gen2009] Was the first successful construction fully homomorphic encryption scheme In 2009 Craig Gentry constructed the first cryptographic system capable of evaluating arbitrary operations. The scheme was constructed over a principal ideal lattice [Gen2009] uses a bootstrap method to prove its security.

\subsection{Principal Ideal Lattice Insecurities}

The cyclotomic field of characteristic two infers so many convenient structures it is often chosen without consideration to any other ring \textbf{TODO: Insert Citation}.

In 2010 at the Public Key Cryptography Conference two researchers Smart and Veracauteren [SV10] introduced another ideal lattice scheme promising fully homomorphic encryption and quantum assumption hardness proofs. In late 2014 GCHQ (Government Communications Head Quarters) announced that it had been working on such a scheme, nearly identical to [SV10] and claimed that not only was it easy to solve using a quantum computer but was subexponential for classical computer systems as well. The attack did not directly apply to most constructions of lattice-based schemes only a handful who had used ideal lattices in the cyclotomic field of characteristic two, where the private keys were represented by principal ideals which were short generators. 

A team of researchers Ronald Cramer, Leo Ducas, Chris Peikert, and Oded Regev [Cra15] who had prior to CESG announcement strongly encouraged new constructions in other fields quickly proved CESGâ€™s claim. Moreover, they proved that in cyclotomic fields with dimensions of prime power order which guaranteed existence of a â€˜shortâ€™ generator the lattice could always be efficiently decoded revealing the private key.
