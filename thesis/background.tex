\section{Equivalent and Stronger Definitions for Security} 

All cryptographic schemes such as RSA, El Gamal, etc. must satisfy the requirements of semantic
security, specifically they must satisfy the Indistinguishable Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) requirement.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IND-CPA} IND-CPA says if an attacker can choose any plaintext and obtain the corresponding ciphertext, then if the system is secure this information does not help them find the private key. However, the issue with CPA is that it depends on the choices of an adversary who is unaware of the secret key. i.e. If the
attacker has two messages then they have no idea if either one contains the key since they don't know what the key is. 
\newline 
In application this classififcation is not sufficient (weakly sufficient) to ensure secure communication. There are situations which occur where the semantic security definition is satisfied but an insecurity still occurs. One
such instance is the case where the user might encrypt their own private key. 
\newline 
By IND-CPA the user can encrypt their private-key but the scheme may return the private-key unencrypted. 
\newline 
By the definition of IND-CPA this action is still classified as secure, even though the scheme has blatantly revealed the users private key.

\section{InfoSec Objectives} 

\subsection{Base Security Objectives}

There are four basic security objectives that must be considered when constructing any system concerned with securing data or information. These four basic definitions allow for the derivation of all other security objectives which may or may not be necessary to ensure the security of information for a given system.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Confidentiality:} The objective of confidentiality ensures that unauthorized users will not be purposefully (or accidentally) give access to resources protected by the system. 
\item \textbf{Integrity:} Ensures that the resources are preserved, used, and appropriately maintained throughout their life-cycle under the system. That is, any data is not alterable in an undetectable manner, retains the same
accuracy as its created date (or registered modification date), and is complete with respect to its creation and activity log. 
\item \textbf{Availability:} Ensuring resources are available to authorized parties as required. 
\item \textbf{Non-repudiation:} Prevention of commitment or action denial.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Derived Security Objectives}

Each implementation of a scheme requires a flexible set of security objectives which are dependent upon the context the system and it's users will employ \textbf{TODO:change wording}. The base definitions for the objectives allow the derivation of all other security objectives.

\section{Formal Security Reduction} 




\section{Post-quantum cryptography} 
The need for new cryptographic systems developed after Peter Shorr proved that the classical number-theoretic schemes could be easily broken by quantum computers. Quantum systems are capable of running algorithms which provide solutions to the mathematical problems the classical schemes base their security reductions on. The development of quantum computing lead to a new area of cryptography called post-quantum cryptography. 
\newline 
Post-quantum cryptography is necessarily distinct from quantum cryptography it's concern is finding and implementing schemes which are secure against quantum-based attacks.
\newline 
Not to be confused with Quantum-cryptography which uses quantum computers to find and implement new quantum cryptosystems.
