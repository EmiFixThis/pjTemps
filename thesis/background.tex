\subsection{Cryptographic Primitives "Does this go here or under PKC" Public Key}

\subsubsection{Problem solved by PKC}

Public Key Cryptography (PKC) solves the problem of how to enable two people who have never met to but need to communicate securely over insecure channels. 
Public-key uses a one-way function as its public key; this function is easy to compute but hard to invert and is available publicly for use as an encryption method for the key owner. A second key called the private key is known only to the
key owner; this key is a trapdoor function which can invert a ciphertext back to its plaintext form. 

Public-key is bidirectional. The forward direction is the one-way public key which easily computes the ciphertext, the backward direction is the trapdoor private key,
which easily inverts to the plaintext.

\subsubsection{Asymmetric & Symmetric Cryptography} 

The concepts of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic-key schemes are given below as independent forms. However, it is rarely the case that these schemes will be applied in this manner particularly in a Public-key asymmetric system.

\subsubsubsection{Symmetric-key Cryptography} 

In cannonical symmetric-key schemes only one key is generated for both the encryption and decryption algorithms. Symmetric-keys must therefore be exchanged over secure channels where both communicating parties have agreed in advance to the method of
encryption and have exchanged secret keys. 
\newline
Formally, we say the two parties are in possesion of a \textit{shared secret} and each party is mutually, as well as equally responsible for the maintenance of the secret which establishes and secures their communications. 
In certain contexts this method can be made to be as secure as an asymmetric key system its main drawback is the shared secret which has the ability to invalidate the
integrity of communications if either party is compromised.
\newline
Additionally since the method requires a secure channel as well as a
shared secret both parties must know they will have a need for
encrypted communication in advance and negotiate the means of
transmission and key exchange prior to communicating. This means the parties must know each other prior to communicating. 

\subsubsubsection{Asymmetric-key Cryptography}

In contrast symmetric-key schemes are determined by two sets of keys one for each party. Each set consists of a private key known only to the owner and a public key which can be widely distributed. It seems at first glance that asymmetric and symmetric cryptosystems are isolated methods of encryption. However, symmetric
encryption is well-suited for the task of assisting asymmetric key
schemes not only for efficiency purposes but also in the role of key
management.

\subsection{Defining Security with Games} 

\subsubsection{Semantic Security: Mental Poker and Partial Information} 

Semantic Security was a game proposed by Goldwasser and Micali in their 1982 paper entitled: \textit{"Probabilistic Encryption & How to Play Mental Poker Keeping Secret All Partial Information"}

The Mental Poker game was based on the implementation of the Diffie-Hellman implementation of RSA by Rivest, Shamir, Adelman, and Rabin.
\footnote{Specifically, Rabin's 1979 Technical Memo "Digitalized
Signatures and Public-key Functions as Intractable as Factorization""}
\footnote{Rivest, Shamir, and Adelmans paper from Publications of
the ACM, February 1978 "A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and
Public Key Cryptosystems."}" 

\textbf{Formal Definition:}
[Gol1982] Proposed the following property for any implementation of a Diffie-Hellman
Public-key Cryptosystem: 
\textit{"An adversary, who knows the encryption of an algorithm and is given the cypher text, cannot obtain any information about the cleartext."} \footnote{[Gol1982] Pg.1, Paragraph 1, Lines 3-6} 
\textbf{Informally:}
A given cryptographic scheme is considered insecure if it is possible for an adversary to recover any information about the plaintext, using the ciphertext, but without knowing the private key. That is, if it is feasible for the adversary to find out some information about the plaintext of the message or recover useful information about the plaintext of the message by manipulating the ciphertext in a reasonable
amount of time, (before he dies of old age or the heat death of the
universe occurs) then the cryptosystem that created those ciphertext
messages (is broke as shit) is insecure. \textit{Kristi fix this wtf dudeâ€¦}

\subsubsection{Weaknesses in the Assumptions of RSA} 

Goldwasser and Micali pointed out that the security assumptions given in [Riv1978] and [Rab1979] had some particularly significant weaknesses that could not be assumed lightly.
Namely,
\begin{itemize} 
\item Assumption 1: Security of the RSA system is based on the intractability of the number theoretic problems of factorization, index finding, and the decision problem of whether or not a number is a quadratic residue with respect to a composite modulus. 
\item This assumption states that the impossible hardness of one of these problems is
equivalent to RSA being computationally infeasible. 
\item Assumption 2: The second assumption is that there exists a trapdoor function $f(x)$ that is easily computed, while $x$ is not easily computed from $f(x)$ unless some additional information is known. 
\item However, Not all hard problems are as hard as other hard problems. In particular, RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large composites is a hard problem. However, not all large composite numbers are hard to factor in fact some are quite easy. For example, if $c$ is a composite such that $c=qp$ for primes $p$ and $q$ then if $p$ and $q$ are close enough together we have some assurances they will be easily factorable. \textbf{Insert Formal Maths Definition}
\end{itemize} 

\section{Equivalent and Stronger Definitions for Security} 

\textbf{INSERT INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IND-CPA} IND-CPA says if an attacker can choose any plaintext and obtain the corresponding ciphertext, then if the system is secure this information does not help them find the private key. However, the issue with CPA is that it depends on the choices of an adversary who is unaware of the secret key. i.e. If the
attacker has two messages then they have no idea if either one contains the key since they don't know what the key is. 
\item The problem that happens is when I decided to encrypt my own key. Then by CPA I could encrypt the key and the scheme return my key unencrypted and it still satisfies
CPA, and even though the scheme has blatantly revealed my private key, technically it is still semantically secure under CPA (except I am not attacking my own accounts and I had better know my own key).

\item \textbf{CCAII}
\end{itemize}

\section{InfoSec & it's Objectives} 
Their are four basic security objectives that must be considered when constructing any system concerned with securing data or information. The four basic definitions allow for the derivation of all other security objectives which may or may not be
necessary to ensure the security of information for a given system.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Confidentiality:} The objective of confidentiality ensures that
unauthorized users will not be purposefully or accidentally give access
to the resources protected by a given security system. Integrity:
Ensures that the resources are preserved, used, and appropriately
maintained throughout their life-cycle under the system. That is, any
data is not alterable in an undetectable manner, retains the same
accuracy as its created date (or registered modification date), and is
complete with respect to its creation and activity log.
