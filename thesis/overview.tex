\section{Overview of Paper Contents}

In the first half of this paper we give an overview of fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) as well as describe the need for such
systems.
We give a summary of the history of FHE schemes and an overview of
the first sucessful construction given by Gentrys Stanford PhD thesis
[\cite{gen20090}] as well as the construction from [\cite{sma20101}].
We contrast these two schemes with an overview of the more general
construction of Peikerts RLWE and discuss the LWE problem, and the
concept of the mathematical basis of hardness assumptions.
We then give an overview of the quantum and general solutions proved
since the GCHQ announcement and summarize the results found by
researchers in the process of verification of these claims.
